[00:19.89] Love, let's talk about love
[00:24.19] Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
[00:28.50] Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
[00:33.53] I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
[00:51.53] 
[00:38.76] This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
[00:42.16] All the stars approach you
[00:44.59] All the stars approach you
[00:47.02] All the stars approach you
[00:48.78] This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
[00:51.98] All the stars are closer
[00:54.56] All the stars are closer
[00:56.83] All the stars are closer
[01:08.83] 
[00:58.43] Tell me what you gon' do to me
[01:00.74] Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
[01:03.77] You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
[01:06.05] But you can't bring the truth to me
[01:08.40] - you and all your expectations
[01:10.78] I don't even want your congratulations
[01:13.13] I recognize your false confidence
[01:14.76] And calculated promises all in your conversation
[01:38.76] 
[01:18.30] I hate people that feel entitled
[01:20.57] Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
[01:23.28] Oh, you important? You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
[01:25.91] Motherf-, I don't even like you
[01:28.07] Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
[01:30.50] That's how you find out who you dealin' with
[01:32.95] A small percentage, who I'm building with
[01:35.74] I want the credit if I'm losing, or I'm winning
[01:37.55] On my momma, that's the realest sh-
[01:55.05] 
[01:39.27] Love, let's talk about love
[01:43.47] Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
[01:47.94] Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
[01:52.97] I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
[02:10.97] 
[01:58.07] This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
[02:01.58] All the stars approach you
[02:03.93] All the stars approach you
[02:06.43] All the stars approach you
[02:07.98] This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
[02:11.17] All the stars are closer
[02:13.82] All the stars are closer
[02:16.17] All the stars are closer
[02:28.17] 
[02:18.63] Skin covered in ego
[02:20.86] Get to talkin', I get involved
[02:23.50] Like a rebound, got no end game
[02:26.07] Got no ways out, got to stay down
[02:28.23] It's the way that you making me feel
[02:30.16] Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
[02:34.16] You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
[02:36.91] If you do, I won't move
[02:48.41] 
[02:39.69] I ain't just cry for no reason (reason)
[02:41.74] I ain't just pray for no reason (reason)
[02:44.32] I give thanks for the days, for the hours
[02:46.57] And another way, another life breathing
[02:49.42] I did it all 'cause it feel good
[02:51.13] I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
[02:54.34] Better live your life
[02:56.33] We were running out of time
[03:09.83] 
[02:58.29] Love, let's talk about love
[03:02.89] Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
[03:07.29] Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
[03:12.26] I know the feeling haunt you (haunt)
[03:30.26] 
[03:17.46] This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
[03:20.63] All the stars approach you
[03:23.24] All the stars approach you
[03:25.64] All the stars approach you
[03:27.32] This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
[03:30.57] All the stars are closer
[03:33.18] All the stars are closer
[03:35.60] All the stars are closer
